- do by using regex to split on last by <field> and assume none if missing and just run as map over groups
- _2 in dump by _1 in other
- _2 in dump by _1 in other
+ _1 if /www/
+ _1 if _2 =~ x
+ .parselyrc
- split by: if a X or not, or if _1 in other_file (subsides comm)
+ in "foo 1\nbar 2" "sum(_2) if _2 < 3" to see how much I can delete
- _1._1 for submatch (e.g. user agent)
- index of <foo> (e.g. when something is processing ines and you want to check where it is)
- skip line e.g. 123\na\nb\nc -> parsely _2 unless idx = 0
- normalize e.g. uniq on
