- do by using regex to split on last by <field> and assume none if missing and just run as map over groups
- _2 in dump by _1 in other
- _2 in dump by _1 in other
+ _1 if /www/
- _1 if _2 =~ x
- .parselyrc
- split by: if a X or not, or if _1 in other_file (subsides comm)
- in "foo 1\nbar 2" "sum(_2) if _2 < 3" to see how much I can delete
