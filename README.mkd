# DISCLAIMER

Do Not Use This. 
At the moment it is mostly a code dump, and a bad one at
that, while I slowly add the stuff I need. One day I will refactor the
code and add useful options and make it reliable and it may become a
useful project for other people. As it stands, it is not, just move on.


## Summary
parsely is a tool to extract and manipulate text files.
Basically, it allows you to run ruby one liners (think `-n/-p`) with some additional
shortcuts. 

parsely is intended as a replacement for all those single-use-and-discard scripts 
in sed/awk/perl/ruby that I constantly end up rewriting, such as counting frequencies, 
summing fields, selecting (c,t)sv rows by field values etc

It does nothing you can't do with a few pipes, sed, awk, grep, ack, perl, 
ruby, sort, uniq, bc, ministats and comm.

It is useful for me because 

* I am very bad at remembering options for command line tools, and get
  confused when BSD and GNU tools don't match
* I always get confused escaping stuff in the shell
* I have written or googled a freq.awk a dozen times

This is most likely useless to you.

## INSTALLATION

Running

    gem install parsely

should be enough to install. 
I use ruby (YARV) 1.9.2 and have not tested this anywhere else.

## SUPPORT

Open a ticket at http://github.com/riffraff/parsely/issues if you want
something in parsely, but I don't think you should use this tool, at
least for the next couple of years. 
Or you can write me an email at rff.rff+parsely@gmail.com if you want.
